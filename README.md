ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for text Editors:

- Show the `type` of the symbol under the cursor.
- Contextual completion for `var`s, `val`s and `def`s.
- Semantic highlighting with `implicit` expansion.
- Add an import for the symbol under the cursor.
- Fast classpath search (types and members).
- Jump to source code or documentation.
- Refactorings (rename, organize imports, extract method).
- Errors and warnings in your code: *red squigglies*.
